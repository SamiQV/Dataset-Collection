Ground-based Observations of XCO2, XCH4, and XCO, Fairbanks, AK, 2016-2019<br>

This dataset provides ground-based column-averaged dry mole fractions (DMFs) of CO2 (xco2), CO (xco), CH4 (xch4), and N2O (xn2o) to supplement satellite-based observations of carbon dynamics of northern boreal ecosystems. Measurements were conducted with Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and two sites on the edges of the Tanana Flats wetlands to the south from 2016-08-04 to 2019-10-31. Single detectors were used during the first campaign at UAF in 2017, then two instruments were updated to dual detectors in early 2018 to allow retrieval of xco and xn2o. Data from additional FTS instruments, operated by Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), employed in these campaigns are included.
